# Research Dashboard API

The Research Dashboard API is a versatile tool that not only extracts information from professors' Lattes curriculum but also qualifies and presents the extracted data in a more convenient and summarized manner. This unique feature allows for in-depth analysis and study of large groups of professors, with a specific focus on their publications, enabling researchers to efficiently assess and evaluate their academic contributions.
